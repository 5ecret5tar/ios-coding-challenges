## Google Places Search

#### Philosophy

We have been trying to get all of our iOS applicants to complete a practical test that we believe is relevant to our core product.  It also allows us to see how you think and how you approach a real world problem from scratch. 

We're not big into puzzles, so nothing about this is a trick. Just approach it as you would any other task for a project.

#### Task Description

1. Create a simple app with a text entry field, and as you type it will display autocomplete results from the Google Places API.
2. Once the user selects one of the results, transition to a new view showing basic information pulled from the Places API. The way you display the results and detailed view is up to you.

When you're all done: 
- Commit it to a repo in your personal Github account that we can access (or zip the project and host it somewhere for us to download)
- If there are any special instructions (besides running `pod install` for Cocoapods) to get your project running, please let us know
- Shoot us a quick email letting us know you're done and we'll clone it and run it from our machines

#### Language

- We use Objective-C mostly still, but feel free to use Swift if you'd prefer.

#### Time Limit

Estimated time to complete the basic functionality (w/o bonus points) is ~4-5 hours, depending on if you've used Google Places API before. Submissions should be received within 2 weeks from the date you received the project.

#### Google Places API

You can obtain an API key by signing up for a free Google Places API account.

#### Review

When reviewing your submission, we'll be looking at the following:

- Code Quality
  - Is the code reasonably easy to understand and well-organized (i.e. broken down into models, networking, views, controllers)?
  - Is your code reasonably robust (i.e. what happens when the server returns errors or there is no internet connection)?

- Functionality
  - Core functionality of searching and showing results
  - Accuracy of the returned results
